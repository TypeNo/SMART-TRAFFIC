# SMART-TRAFFIC
A proposed comprehensive AI-driven solution includes immediate accident detection
and reporting, marking accident locations for increased awareness, notifying relevant
authorities of infrastructure improvements, displaying available parking slots, streamlining
parking payments, automating toll payments, and implementing AI-based vehicle scanning
for enhanced security and law enforcement. This integrated approach aims to address the
diverse issues in transportation, promoting safety, convenience, and efficiency on Malaysian
roads.
